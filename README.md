# Mantil

Mantil is a cloud development toolset for Go and AWS Lambda.

Cloud-native development demands a new approach to building, launching and observing cloud apps. Mantil is a 
modern Go toolset for creating and managing AWS Lambda projects.

In this early version, Mantil addresses fundamental issues often encountered while building and launching the apps:
* setting up a new AWS Lambda project from scratch or an existing template
* setting up a local development environment and tieing everything with AWS
* deploying the app on every change
* code testing via standard go tests or by invoking a specific function
* getting logs instantly
* supporting multiple development stages and parallel lines of deployment

Please, go and try it! Let us know your thoughts.
